# What is this this project?
This is a simple yet effective bot that connects to the OpenSea and Twitter APIs to produce a bot which will tweet every time a Satoshible is sold.

# Why is it on GitHub?
I've put it on GitHub so that people can use this to create their own OpenSea sales bots for Twitter without writing loads of code.

# What language is this coded in?
Python, python, python, python.

# Is it easy to configure?
Nope. Everything is hard-coded. Sorry.

# How often does this poll for sales?
Every 5 minutes it polls for sales from the last 5 minutes.

# READ BEFORE USING
You'll need a Twitter Developer Account so you can interact with Twitter's API. You'll also need to request an OpenSea API key so you don't get rate-limited.
